## About Me

Currently I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, SRM University AP.  
Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Harish-Chandra Research Institute, and IIIT Delhi. I completed my PhD at Indian Institute of Technology Ropar. My research interests include:

- Special values of L-functions  
- L-functions in Selberg Class  
- Applications of Euler constants to divisor problems  
- Euler–Kronecker constants
